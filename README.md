- 👋 Hi, I’m @ms-e-g
- 👀 I’m interested in getting across the features of GitHub
- 🌱 I’m currently studying to become a teacher. I'm from an IT background, but pretty old school skills knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to use GitHub to complete some of my study, expect I'll need some help from the GitHub community to get this done.
